# Lifese 2.0

Have you ever felt a guilty pleasure before? You know, just having fun in your free time, but feeling your conscience weighing on you because you are "*wasting time*". This usually leads to:
1. Not having fun during your free time
2. Working all the time instead, which will inevitably lead to **burnout**

If only there were a way to accurately convert your hard work into free time... 


**Oh, right! That's *exactly* why I made Lifese!**

## How It Works

### Quests

In Lifese 2.0, you can create three types of **Quests**:

- **Missions**:  
  Tasks you want to do (gain points when you complete them).  
  *Example: reading a chapter, going for a walk, brushing your teeth.*

- **Offenses**:  
  Actions you want to avoid (lose points if you do them).  
  *Example: smoking, skipping workouts, eating junk food.*

- **Tasks**:  
  Special goals where you gain points if you succeed, or lose points if you fail.  
  *Example: studying for an exam, cleaning your room by a deadline.*

### Points

- For each **Mission**, **Offense**, and **Task**, you will assign a number of **points**. Those **points** will be your life's currency.

- Each **point** is worth **10 minutes**. So if you assign **1 point** to a **Mission** like reading, you earn **1 point** every time you complete. That's 10 minutes of free time!

- On the contrary, if you assign **5 points** to an **Offense** like smoking, you lose *50 minutes* of your free time whenever you smoke. 

- And then you have the hybrid **Tasks**, where assigning **3 points** to a **Task** means you earn **3 points** if you complete it, and lose **3 points** if you fail it. 

- To spend your points, head to the point spending tab, choose the number of points you want to use, and set a timer afterwards to keep track of the time you've used up.

- Pretty simple, yet pretty effective. This way, whenever you spend your free time doing something fun, you will know why you totally deserve it!

## Background

Lifese originally began as a small Discord bot. I had no way of hosting it 24/7, and the lack of a UI made it difficult to use. That's why I decided to rebuild it from scratch as a standalone web app.

---

## Future Plans

- Allow users to customize the value of a point.
- Add cloud backup.
